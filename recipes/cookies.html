            I don't think I have to tell you what cookies are. But know that this one is better than any of them and will change how you see the world and yourself. 
            It will unearth in you something you thought you had lost and give you the feeling of receiving a thousand suns as a gift. 
            No but for real this is a real recipe and they're good.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g of butter</li>
            <li>340g of sugar</li>
            <li>30g of maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>400g of flour</li>
            <li>15g of baking powder</li>
            <li>200g of chocolate <em>(usually I do 100g of white chocolate and 100g of milk chocolate)</em></li>
            <li>2 pinches of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter and wisk it with the sugar and maple syrup.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Then add the flour, salt and baking powder and mix everything up very gently with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Now, put the mix in the fridge, if it's warm when we add the chocolate it's gonna be not good <em>(trust me)</em>.</li>
            <li>So take this time to cut the chocolate into chunks. If you're using chocolate chips, then just wait like 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now, add the chocolate to the dough and again mix it in gently with a spatula, I don't know why this has an impact but it does.</li>
            <li>It's hard and I never do it enough but at this point you got to put the dough back in the fridge and wait until it's firm.</li>
            <li>Turn on the oven at 200°c <em>(I don't do farein-whatever it is called)</em> and roll the dough into balls <em>(if you waited enough,
            it's a little hard but your first batch of cookies is gonna be better than the rest of us)</em>. I use an ice-cream scoop and it's great. But hands work fine !</li>
            <li>Now, my oven is medium sized I would say, so I can put 6 balls on a baking sheet without my cookies melting together. You do you. The cookies should bake for 5-7
            minutes <em>(the less they bake, the more gooey)</em> at 200°c <em>(only put them in when the oven is fully warmed up)</em>. My golden time is 6 minutes and 20 seconds but every oven is different.</li>
            <li>Take out the cookies of the oven and let them rest for a little while. They are indeed gooey little guys and will melt in your hands. 10 minutes should be enough.</li>
            <li>If you waited until the dough was really cold, they're gonna be heavenly. If not the first batch is always a little dry. The thing is, I usually bake 6 and put
            all the other cookie dough balls into the bag that goes into the freezer. That way I always have fresh cookies on hand and life is hard so it really helps.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h4>Baking the frozen cookies</h4>
            <p>
                Well it's actually the exact same 5-7 minutes in the oven at 200°c on a baking sheet, straight from the freezer. They're gonna be even better.

        <h4>Going beyond</h2>
            <p>
                I never tried it <strong>BUT</strong> I'm pretty sure if I made smaller cookie dough balls, froze them and mixed them in vanilla ice-cream if would make
                an amazing Ben & Jerry's Cookie Dough dupe. Imagine with homemade ice-cream !!! The possibilities are endless !
